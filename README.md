This repository contains code to run algorithms for the Poisson process, target method and knee method for determining stopping points as described in our EMNLP 2019 paper "Modelling Stopping Criteria for Search Resultsusing Poisson Processes" https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.06239.

The code can be run by downloading a copy of the CLEF TAR data (available at https://github.com/CLEF-TAR/tar) into the data folder and running: 
python process_data.py
python run_stopping_point_algorithms.py
